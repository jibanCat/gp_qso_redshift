# update note (4 July 2020)

Some spectra are missing in `uniform_prior` folder and the `zqso_only_catalog` file in `uniform_prior` folder still includes DLAs.

For cleanness, please use the updated version of files in `uniform_prior_Jun24`,
which doesn't have any DLA information and the spectra in preloaded_qsos.mat are
up-to-date.
